# Chipabu

Chipabu is a mod for Chinese Parents (v2.0.0.4) that does some things.

Made for whatever my girlfriend needs, I don't play the game üòù

## Changes

- Fixed display of signs in composition minigame
- Restores permanent per-turn stat increases from career endings

## Installing

- Download the `BepInEx_win_x86` asset from [the latest version of BepInEx 5.X](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest).
- Extract it to the installation folder of Chinese Parents.
- Navigate to the `BepInEx` folder and create a folder called `plugins`.
- Download the [latest version of the mod](https://github.com/qixils/Chipabu/releases/latest).

You can now compile with `dotnet build`.
